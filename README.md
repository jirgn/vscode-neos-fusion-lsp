# ðŸš§ NEOS Fusion & AFX ðŸš§

This package is still **WIP**

The HTML tokenizer is a slightly simplified version of [html-tokenizer](https://github.com/greim/html-tokenizer) by [Greg Reimer](https://twitter.com/greim). You can check the status of the Merge Request [here](https://github.com/greim/html-tokenizer/pull/6).

The Fusion Syntax highlighting is copied from [Neos Fusion Language support](https://github.com/networkteam/vscode-neos-fusion) created by [networkteam](https://networkteam.com).

## Functions

Currently the Extension supports simple completion and go-to-definition for Fusion Prototypes.

Due to incomplete parsing of EEL-Expressions the lexer can stop working midway through a file and functionality will be reduced.
